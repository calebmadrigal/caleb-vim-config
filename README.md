caleb-vim-config
================

My .vim directory and .vimrc file.

It provides the following:
* Basic config for things like making searches global by default and expanding tabs into spaces.
* Nice syntax color schemes for both gVim and vim.
* VimClojure installed and configured to provide things like Rainbow Parentheses.
